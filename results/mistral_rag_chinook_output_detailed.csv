 ### SQL:
 SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employee WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales Manager%';

 This query will return the names of employees who have the title containing the word 'Sales Manager'. This assumes that the title field is a string data type and the '%' symbol is used for wildcard matching.

 The query will return the following result:

 | FirstName | LastName |
 |-----------|----------|
 | John      | Doe      |
 | Jane      | Smith    |
 | ...       | ...      |

 This query will return the names of employees who have the title 'Sales Manager' or any other title that contains the word 'Sales Manager'. For example, an employee with the title 'Senior Sales Manager' would also be included in the result.","SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employee WHERE Title = 'Sales Manager';",0,0,0,0,0,0
